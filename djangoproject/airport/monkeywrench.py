"""
MonkeyWrenches are spontaneous events thrown in the game to produce some
unpredictableness.  They are things that happen to flights and airports
such as cancellations, delays, etc.

This module produces a MonkeyWrench base class, which does nothing,
subsecrent MonkeyWrenches should subclass the class, and implement a
throw() method which actually does something.  It should also probably send
a broadcast message to the Game notifying players of what happened.

The MonkeyWrenchFactory collects all the various MonkeyWrench classes, and
when it's create() method is called, picks one at random, instantiates it
and returns it to the caller
